# Dream WatchFace
This is one of my most favorite projects I have done. I've been using it for almost a year!
I titled this watch face Dream because I got the idea for this watch face in 2016 (I think) 
when I was on a camping trip. As soon as I woke up I decided to sketch out my idea in the dirt with a stick. 
A few years later, once I owned a smart watch, I created the clock using [Processing.](https://processing.org/) 
I might be biased but I love the modern and minimalist design.

There seems to be an error on my part or a bug? on line 36 when used on the smart watch. Works fine in Java.
```java
fill(get(0,0));
```
